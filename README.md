- Privacy setting (public or invite-only)

#### 2. **Invite Your Circle** 👥
Share your goal with:
- Family members for shared expenses
- Friends for group adventures
- Community for collective goals
- Or keep it public for anyone to join

#### 3. **Save Together** 💰
Everyone contributes at their own pace:

- Get motivated by group progress

#### 4. **Achieve & Celebrate** 🎉
